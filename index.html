         <p>He starts off by saying talk to your self only and don’t share secrets with other human beings cos humans can be deceptive. 
“Ba nu so, ma ba eniyan so” translates to - “talk to yourself, don’t talk to anybody else”
In verse 2 he says “your tears will dry, and your sadness will become laughter. We only know those we love, we don’t know those who truly loves us, so keep your secrets to yourself and don’t share with people”
In verse 3 he says “If you’ll eat with the devil, your spoon must be long, Who doesn’t know how to behave will be disgraced cos society is very political” </p>
