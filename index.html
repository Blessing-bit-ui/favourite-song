        <h2> What is music</h2>
         <p>
        Music is an art form that organizes sound in a way that is expressive, meaningful, and often enjoyable. It typically consists of elements such as melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. Music can be created using instruments, the human voice, or digital tools, and it serves various purposes, including entertainment, communication, emotional expression, and cultural storytelling.
Music exists in many styles and genres, from classical to rock, jazz to hip-hop, and electronic to folk. It can evoke emotions, bring people together, and even influence mood and behavior. Essentially, music is a universal language that transcends barriers and connects people worldwide.

            <p>He starts off by saying talk to your self only and don’t share secrets with other human beings cos humans can be deceptive. 
“Ba nu so, ma ba eniyan so” translates to - “talk to yourself, don’t talk to anybody else”
In verse 2 he says “your tears will dry, and your sadness will become laughter. We only know those we love, we don’t know those who truly loves us, so keep your secrets to yourself and don’t share with people”
In verse 3 he says “If you’ll eat with the devil, your spoon must be long, Who doesn’t know how to behave will be disgraced cos society is very political” </p>
